# EatSafe Surrey

## Intro

EatSafe Surrey lets you view eatery health inspections. 

With EatSafe Surrey, you can access comprehensive records of food establishment inspections. This website displays the level of risk - low, moderate or high - associated with each of your preferred Surrey dining locations, indicating their compliance with food handling safety standards. 

## Features

### Map View

Display a map of Surrey using Google Maps and mark all the restaurants in the area. Our website features markers that are clustered together to improve readability. Users can click on each marker to be redirected to that restaurant's details page.

The map also includes a search function, allowing users to quickly find a specific restaurant. When a restaurant is selected from the search suggestions, the map will zoom in on that location and open its informational window.

### List View

Present a list of restaurants in Surrey. Initially, only 20 restaurants will be displayed when the user first clicks on the page. As the user scrolls down, more restaurants will automatically load, resulting in a cleaner and more organized webpage.

### Future Updates

In the near future, I plan on incorporating local web storage so that data can be saved after being retrieved from the Fraser Health API.

Additionally, we will continue to enhance the web UI to enhance its aesthetic quality and make it more visually appealing to users. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
